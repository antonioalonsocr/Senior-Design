raspberry_pi_python folder holds all the files in the raspberry pi.
Special attention can be paid to ```/raspberry_pi_python/LCD/LCD40x2.py``` as this is our testing script for writing to the LCD screen.<br><br>

LCD_prints.py contains functions useful for printing some common things, e.g. a character displaying a visual form of how charged the battery is.
